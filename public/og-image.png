This is a placeholder. You need to create a 1200x630px image with your logo and company information.

For now, the system will use /logo.png as the Open Graph image.

To create a proper Open Graph image:
1. Use a design tool (Canva, Figma, Photoshop)
2. Create an image 1200x630px
3. Add your logo
4. Add text: "STE-SCPB | Export Cacao & Café Cameroun"
5. Use your brand colors
6. Save as og-image.png in the public folder
